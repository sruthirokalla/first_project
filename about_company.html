    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the --add option. If you want to update or unset 
        an option which can occur on multiple lines, a value-pattern (which is an extended regular expression, unless the --fixed-value
        option is given) needs to be given. Only the existing values that match the pattern are updated or unset. If you want to handle
        the lines that do not match the pattern, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also EXAMPLES), 
        but note that this only works when the --fixed-value option is not in use.</p>
